### Steps to Configure Agent Instructions

1. **Conversation Purpose**: Specify the purpose of the conversation. This will help guide the agent during the call and will be used to generate the analytics.
   - Example: `Get prospects to schedule an appointment with a Contactship agent to see how we can scale their business to the next level`

2. **Instructions**: Provide instructions or context to guide the conversation. We recommend seeing the [Prompt Engineering Guide](/agents/prompt-engineering-guide) to learn how to write effective instructions.
   - Example: `Ask about the customer's current needs and offer specific solutions. Be sure to mention the current 10% discount promotion on services.`
