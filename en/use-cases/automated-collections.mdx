## The problem

Your collections team has to call hundreds of debtors every month. Often they don't answer, calls are repetitive, and finding out about a payment commitment can take hours or days. It's hard to scale without hiring more people.

## The solution

With ContactShip you can launch **mass collection campaigns** where your AI agent negotiates with each debtor in a personalized way, and **notifies you instantly** when someone commits to pay.

The agent:
- Calls the debtor by name
- Informs them of the amount and concept of their debt
- Negotiates a payment commitment with a specific date
- Records everything discussed
- Sends you an email if they secure a commitment

## How to set it up step by step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a collections agent">
    Go to [Agents](/en/agents/overview) and create an agent with clear instructions. For example: *"You are a professional and respectful collections agent. Your goal is to inform the debtor about their outstanding debt and secure a payment commitment with a concrete date. Be firm but empathetic."*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure call tags">
    Create [Call Tags](/en/agents/call-tags) like:
    - **Payment commitment**: *"Use this tag when the debtor commits to a specific date to pay."*
    - **Refuses payment**: *"Use this tag when the debtor denies the debt or refuses to pay."*
    - **Asks for more time**: *"Use this tag when the debtor asks for an extension without committing to a date."*

    Enable **email notifications** on the tags that matter to you to find out instantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your campaign">
    Go to [Campaigns](/en/campaigns/overview) and create a new campaign. Load your contacts with debt data (amount, concept, due date) as additional fields so the agent can use them in the conversation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch and monitor">
    Calls run simultaneously. Every time a debtor commits, you'll receive an email with the tag, reason, and a direct link to the call.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Result

- Hundreds of collection calls launched in **minutes**
- Each conversation **personalized** with debt data
- **Instant notifications** when there's a payment commitment
- Filter calls by tag to quickly see who committed
- Your team focuses only on cases that require human intervention
