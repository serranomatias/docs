## The problem

When you invest in marketing and new leads come in, response time is everything. If you don't contact them the same day (2-3 days at most), that lead goes cold and the opportunity is lost. But your team can't keep up with calling everyone instantly.

## The solution

With ContactShip + an automation tool (like [N8N](/en/integrations/n8n) or [Make](/en/integrations/make)), you can have **each lead receive a call from an AI agent in less than 30 seconds** after submitting a form.

The agent:
- Greets them by name
- Knows what product or service they're interested in
- Qualifies the lead by asking key questions
- Schedules a meeting when appropriate
- All information is recorded in the CRM

## How to set it up step by step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your AI agent">
    Go to [Agents](/en/agents/overview) and create an agent with qualification instructions. For example: *"You are a sales advisor. Your goal is to understand the lead's needs, qualify them, and schedule a demo meeting."*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your form">
    Use any provider: Tally, Google Forms, Typeform, or a custom form. Include fields like name, phone, email, company, and service of interest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the form to ContactShip">
    Use [N8N](/en/integrations/n8n) or [Make](/en/integrations/make) so that when the form is submitted, it automatically triggers a call with your agent. Pass the form data as **Additional Data** so the AI personalizes the conversation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure tags (optional)">
    Create [Call Tags](/en/agents/call-tags) like "Interested", "Meeting scheduled", or "Not qualified" so the system notifies you and you can filter results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the results">
    Each call is recorded with audio, transcription, summary, and sentiment. From the CRM you can see the full lead history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Result

- Leads contacted in **less than 30 seconds**
- Each conversation **personalized** with form data
- Your team only handles **already qualified** leads
- All info centralized in the CRM with no manual entry

<Tip>
You can add a **5-15 minute delay** so the call feels more natural and not so immediate after filling out the form.
