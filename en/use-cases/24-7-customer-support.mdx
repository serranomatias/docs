## The problem

Your customers call outside business hours and no one answers. Or your support team can't keep up with the volume of incoming calls. Hiring more people is expensive and service quality varies.

## The solution

With ContactShip you can **buy a phone number** and assign it an AI agent that handles every incoming call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The agent answers questions, resolves issues, schedules appointments, and escalates to humans when needed.

## How to set it up step by step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy your phone number">
    Go to [My Numbers](/en/platform/my-numbers) and buy a local number. We currently have availability in 🇦🇷 Argentina, 🇲🇽 Mexico, 🇨🇴 Colombia, 🇨🇱 Chile, and 🇺🇸 United States. Payment is processed through Stripe and costs **$10 USD/month**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a customer support agent">
    Go to [Agents](/en/agents/overview) and create an agent with support instructions. For example: *"You are a customer support assistant. Your goal is to resolve customer inquiries in a friendly and efficient way. If you can't resolve something, offer to schedule a call with a human."*

    Configure their [identity](/en/agents/identity) with name, tone, and personality that represent your company.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign the agent to the number">
    In **My Numbers**, click **Manage Agent** on your new number and select the agent you created. The number goes from offline to active instantly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure tags (optional)">
    Create [Call Tags](/en/agents/call-tags) to automatically classify calls: "Query resolved", "Requires follow-up", "Upset customer", etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your number">
    Share the number on your website, social media, business cards, or wherever you want. Every call will be answered by your AI agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>
