## The problem

You have a database of leads or customers you want to contact to sell, upsell, or reactivate. But calling them one by one takes weeks, and call quality varies depending on who makes the call. It's not scalable.

## The solution

With [ContactShip campaigns](/en/campaigns/overview), you can load thousands of contacts and launch simultaneous calls where your AI agent **sells, qualifies, schedules meetings, and personalizes each conversation** with the data you load.

## How to set it up step by step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a sales agent">
    Go to [Agents](/en/agents/overview) and create an agent with sales instructions. Define their goal (sell, schedule demo, qualify), tone, and what information they should collect. The better your [instructions](/en/agents/instructions), the better each call will be.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare your contact list">
    Put together an Excel with your contact data: name, phone, country, and any additional data you want (company, product of interest, purchase history, etc.). You can [download the template](/en/campaigns/overview) from the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the campaign">
    Go to [Campaigns](/en/campaigns/overview), create a new one, and configure:
    - Outbound number
    - AI agent
    - Time range for calls
    - Number of retries
    - Immediate or scheduled start
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load contacts and launch">
    Upload the Excel, verify that the data maps correctly, and launch. Calls start in 3-5 minutes and run in parallel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze results">
    In the **Calls** section, review the status of each one: audio, transcription, summary, sentiment, and whether the agent achieved its goal or not. Use tags to filter the results that matter to you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Result

- Thousands of personalized calls in **minutes**, not weeks
- Each contact receives a conversation **adapted to their data**
- Scheduled meetings, qualified leads, and interest recorded automatically
- Full visibility: audio, transcription, and summary of every call
- Your sales team only handles the **hottest** leads

<Tip>
Start with a small group (20-50 contacts) to fine-tune the agent before scaling to your full database.
