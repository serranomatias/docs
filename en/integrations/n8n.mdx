## What you need to get started

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. **An N8N account** — either [self-hosted](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) (open source) or the [Cloud version](https://n8n.io).
2. **A ContactShip account** — you can [sign up for free](https://app.contactship.ai) and try the platform.

## Step 1: Install the ContactShip node in N8N

ContactShip has a community node in N8N that you need to install in your account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    In your N8N account, go to **Settings** from the side menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Community Nodes">
    Inside settings, scroll down to the **Community Nodes** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the node">
    Click **Install** and type:

    ```
    n8n-nodes-contactship
    ```

    Accept and install. That's it — the ContactShip node will now appear in your account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Once installed, when you create a new workflow and search for "ContactShip", you'll see the community node with **Triggers** (execute when something happens) and **Actions** (perform an action, like making a call).
</Tip>

## Step 2: Set up your credentials (API Key)

For N8N to connect with your ContactShip account, you need to create a credential with your API Key.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new credential in N8N">
    When you add a ContactShip node for the first time, it will ask you to set up a credential. Click **Create New Credential** and give it a name you can easily identify (for example, your account name).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your API Key from ContactShip">
    Log in to [ContactShip](https://app.contactship.ai), go to the side menu, and enter **Organizations**. Scroll down to **API Keys** and click **Generate Key**.

    <Frame>
      ![API Keys](/images/apikeys.png)
    </Frame>

    <Warning>
      The API key is only shown once. Copy it and store it securely. Anyone with access to this key can execute actions on your account.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste the API Key in N8N">
    Go back to N8N, paste the key in the **API Key** field, and click **Save**. The connection is ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Configure your first call node

Now that the connection is ready, you can set up your first node to make a call with an AI agent.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Make an AI Phone Call node">
    In your workflow, add a ContactShip node and select the **Make an AI Phone Call** action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the AI agent">
    Choose which agent you want to make the call. If you don't have an agent yet, you can create one from the [Agents section](https://app.contactship.ai) on the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the outbound number">
    Select which phone number you want to call from. You'll see the numbers already registered in your account.

    <Note>
    If you don't see your number, you can add it from **My Numbers** on the platform, or type it directly using **Expression** mode with the area code included.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the recipient details">
    Complete the required fields:

    - **To Number**: The number you want to call.
    - **Full Name**: The person's name.
    - **Country**: The contact's country (important for timezone control in campaigns).

    And optionally:
    - **Email**: The contact's email address.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Enrich the call with additional data

This is one of the most powerful parts of the integration. You can pass additional information to the AI so it **personalizes the call**.

Inside the node, click **Add Fields** and select **Additional Data**. Here you can add key-value pairs with any relevant information:

| Key | Value | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| `Product of interest` | `Inbound AI Agents` | The AI knows which product to discuss |
| `Source` | `TikTok form` | The AI knows where the lead came from |
| `Budget` | `$1000 USD` | The AI knows the budget range |

<Warning>
It's important that the **key is descriptive**. If you just put "x", the AI won't understand what it means. Use clear names like "Product of interest" or "Required service".
</Warning>

### Delay (optional)

You can also add a **Delay** from **Add Fields**. This field accepts a number in **minutes** indicating how long to wait before launching the call.

For example, a delay of `5` means the call launches 5 minutes later, which can feel more natural than calling instantly.

---

## Real example: Form → Automatic call in 30 seconds

Let's walk through a practical example: when someone fills out a form, they automatically get called by an AI agent.

### Create your form

You can use any form provider: [Tally](https://tally.so), Google Forms, Typeform, or even a custom form. In this example we use Tally with fields like:

- First and last name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Company name
- Number of employees
- Required service

### Build the flow in N8N

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Webhook as Trigger">
    In your workflow, add a **Webhook** (Trigger) node. Configure it with:
    - **Method**: POST
    - **Path**: A descriptive name like `form-submission-tally`

    You'll get two URLs: a **test** URL and a **production** URL. Use the test URL while setting things up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the form to the Webhook">
    In Tally (or your provider), go to **Integrations → Webhooks** and paste the N8N webhook URL. Activate the connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run a test to see the data">
    Temporarily disable the ContactShip node, click **Test Workflow** in N8N, and fill out the form. You'll see the information arriving at the webhook: name, phone, email, company, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map the data dynamically">
    Re-enable the ContactShip node and connect the form fields to the node fields:

    - **To Number** ← Phone number from the form
    - **Full Name** ← First Name + Last Name from the form
    - **Email** ← Email from the form
    - **Additional Data** ← Company, required service, etc.

    You do this by dragging values from the left panel (input) to the node fields. N8N automatically creates the dynamic expressions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the complete flow">
    Click **Test Workflow**, fill out the form, and within seconds you'll receive the AI agent call with all the lead's information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Remember that you need credits in your ContactShip account to make calls. You can add credits from **Organizations → Plans** on the platform.
</Note>

## Review the results in ContactShip

All calls made through N8N will appear in the **Calls** section of ContactShip, where you can:

- Listen to the **audio recording** of the call
- Read the full **transcription**
- View an AI-generated **summary**
- See the user's **sentiment** during the call
- Check the **call status** (completed, unanswered, etc.)
- Access the **contact profile** with history, tags, comments, and more

## Tips for a successful integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep your API Key secure">
    Don't share it publicly. Anyone with access to your key can perform actions on your account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the production URL when you activate your workflow">
    The test URL only works while in test mode. When you activate your scenario, make sure to update the form's webhook to the production URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be descriptive with Additional Data">
    The AI receives the key names exactly as you type them. "Product of interest" is much better than "data1".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use delay for a more natural feel">
    A delay of 5-15 minutes can make the call feel more natural and less immediate after filling out a form.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Save your workflow often">
    N8N doesn't auto-save. If the browser closes, you could lose your work. Save frequently.
  </Accordion>
