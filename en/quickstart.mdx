### Conversational AI Voice Agents

Our primary focus is on <a href="agents/overview" target="_self">conversational AI voice agents</a>. These agents can perform tasks such as prospecting calls, sales, support, customer service, collections, receptionist duties, and appointment scheduling.

Once your agent is created, you can use it in various ways:

📞 **<a href="campaigns/overview" target="_self"> Outbound Call Campaigns</a>**: Configure campaigns, assign an agent, and upload contacts for the agent to make calls.<br/><br/>
📲 **<a href="inbound/overview" target="_self">Inbound Call Handling</a>**: Assign a phone number for your business to handle incoming calls.<br/><br/>
🌐 **<a href="widgets/overview" target="_self">Web Call Widget</a>**: Embed a widget on your website or platform to allow customers/users/leads to make web calls with the agent.<br/><br/>
🔄 **<a href="api/overview" target="_self">API Integration</a>**: Automate workflows through the API.
