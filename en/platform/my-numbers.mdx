## Verify Your Number

### Verification Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access My Numbers">
    Navigate to the **Organizations** menu and select **My Numbers**. You'll find an add new number button at the top.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Number">
    Enter the phone number you want to verify and click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Verification">
    You'll receive an automated call to your number. On screen, you'll see a code that you'll need to enter using your phone's keypad.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Once you've entered the code correctly, you'll see a green checkmark on the platform confirming successful verification.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This process verifies your ownership of the number and allows your contacts to see this number when you make calls. It doesn't affect your phone plan or incur additional charges.
</Note>

## Purchase a Number

You can now buy a phone number directly from the platform — no forms or waiting required. Your number will be ready to make and receive calls with your AI agent 24/7.

### Available countries

You can currently purchase local numbers in **5 countries**: 🇦🇷 Argentina, 🇲🇽 Mexico, 🇨🇴 Colombia, 🇨🇱 Chile, and 🇺🇸 United States.

### How to buy your number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to My Numbers">
    In the side menu, go to **My Numbers** and click the button to add a new number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the country">
    Choose the country where you want your local number from the available options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your number">
    You'll see the available numbers for that country. Select the one you prefer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a payment method">
    Enter your payment method. The entire process is backed by **Stripe** to ensure the security of your transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the purchase">
    The payment is processed and your number is registered immediately in your account. The cost is **$10 USD/month**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Assign an AI agent to your number

Once purchased, the number will appear in **My Numbers** with an **offline** status (because it doesn't have an agent assigned yet). To activate it:

1. Click **Manage Agent** on your number.
2. Select any of the AI agents you've already created.
3. Click **Assign Agent**.

That's it — your number is now active and any incoming call will be handled by your AI agent.

<Tip>
This is ideal for having a dedicated customer service number that answers calls 24/7, or for using as an outbound number in campaigns and automated calls.
</Tip>
