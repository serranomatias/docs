## Managing Team Members

Team members are the users who have access to your ContactShip organization. Each member can have different roles and permissions, allowing you to control access levels within the platform.

## Inviting New Members

To invite new members to your organization:

1. Go to the **Organizations** menu
2. Within Organizations, access the **Members** submenu
3. Click the **Invite Member** button
4. Enter the new member's email address
5. Click **Invite**

After sending the invitation:
- You'll see a confirmation message indicating the invitation was sent successfully
- An invitation link will be displayed that you can copy and share directly
- The invitee will automatically receive an email with the link to confirm their invitation

<Tip>
  The invitee can join the organization in two ways: using the link you share directly or through the invitation email they receive. Both methods work!
</Tip>

## Managing Existing Members

From the same Members submenu within Organizations, you can:

1. View all current organization members
2. Find the member you want to modify
3. Select their new role from the dropdown (User, Moderator, or Administrator)
4. Changes are applied immediately

## Organization Switching

Once a member belongs to multiple organizations, they'll see an organization selector in their user interface. This makes it easy to switch between different organizations they have access to.

## Member Roles

ContactShip offers three levels of access:

### User
- Basic access to assigned features
- Can use platform functions based on granted permissions
- Cannot modify team settings or permissions

### Moderator
- Intermediate access level
- Can manage specific team functions
- Limited administrative capabilities

### Administrator
- Full platform access
- Can manage team members and their roles
- Controls all organization settings and permissions

<Note>
  Choose roles carefully based on your team members' responsibilities. You can always modify roles and permissions later through the members section.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Be cautious when assigning administrator roles, as they have full access to your organization's settings and can manage other members' permissions.
