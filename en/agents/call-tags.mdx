## What are Call Tags?

When you handle a high volume of calls, it's hard to manually review every conversation to find out what happened. **Call Tags** solve that problem: our AI system automatically analyzes each call and assigns tags based on what occurred during the conversation.

You can also set up **email notifications** so you're instantly informed when a specific tag is applied — no need to constantly check the platform.

<Note>
Tags are applied automatically when each call ends. You don't need to do anything manually — the AI takes care of everything.
</Note>

## What can you do with them?

Tags allow you to:

    Receive an email notification when something important happens in a call, like a payment commitment or an upset customer.

### Example use cases

- **Payment commitment**: Get notified when a debtor commits to paying on a specific date.
- **Upset customer**: Quickly detect calls where the customer expressed frustration or anger.
- **Meeting scheduled**: Know when a meeting or appointment was arranged during the call.
- **Purchase interest**: Identify prospects who showed real interest in your product or service.
- **Requires follow-up**: Flag calls where something was left unresolved.

## How to create a tag

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your agent">
    Navigate to the **Agents** section and select the agent you want to add tags to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Call Tags section">
    Inside the agent's settings, you'll find the **Call Tags** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new tag">
    Click add and fill in the following fields:

    - **Name**: A short, clear name for the tag (e.g., *Payment commitment*).
    - **Description**: This is the most important part — tell the AI **when it should apply this tag**. Be clear and specific.
    - **Color**: Choose a color to visually identify it in the call list.
    - **Notification**: Enable this option if you want to receive an email when the tag is applied, and select which users in your organization should be notified.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and you're done">
    Once created, the tag is active immediately. From now on, the AI will automatically apply it to calls made by that agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The description is key

The tag description is what the AI uses to decide whether to apply it to a call or not. The clearer and more specific it is, the better your results will be.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good example">
    **Name**: Payment commitment

    **Description**: *"Use this tag when the debtor commits to a specific date to make their payment. Be strict when identifying a real commitment — saying 'I'll see what I can do' is not the same as saying 'I'll pay on Tuesday the 18th'."*
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bad example">
    **Name**: Payment

    **Description**: *"When they talk about money."*

    This is too vague. The AI could tag any call where money is mentioned, even if there's no real commitment.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
If you notice a tag isn't being applied exactly the way you want, adjust the description. You can refine it over time until it works perfectly for your use case.
</Tip>

## Email notifications

When you enable notifications on a tag, every time the AI applies it to a call, the selected users will receive an email with:

- The **tag** that was applied
- The **reason** the AI decided to apply it (with a quote from the call)
- **Date**, **duration**, and **status** of the call
- A **direct link** to view the call on the platform

<Note>
If you're not receiving notification emails, check your **spam** folder — emails might end up there the first time.
</Note>

## Filter calls by tag

In the platform's call list, you can filter by any tag to quickly find the conversations you're looking for.

For example, if you want to see all calls where there was a payment commitment, simply select that tag in the filter and you'll get only those calls.

You can also:
- **Remove a tag** from a call if you think it was applied incorrectly.
- **Manually add a tag** to a call that wasn't automatically tagged.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many tags can I create?">
    You can create as many tags as you need. We recommend starting with a few well-defined ones and adding more as you understand what information you need.

    Yes. If multiple relevant things happen during a single call, the AI can apply multiple tags.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do tags work in real time?">
    Tags are applied when the call ends, after the AI analyzes the full conversation. They are not applied during the call.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I disable notifications without deleting the tag?">
