### Inbound Call Handling

For inbound call handling, you need to:

1. **Assign a Phone Number**: Purchase or assign a phone number to your AI voice agent.
2. **Configure Call Routing**: Set up rules for how incoming calls should be routed to the agent.
3. **Monitor and Manage Calls**: Use the dashboard to monitor call performance and manage ongoing calls.
