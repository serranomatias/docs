## How to create a campaign

<Steps>
  <Step title="Campaign details">
    Go to **Campaigns** in the side menu and click **New Campaign**. Configure:

    - **Name** for your campaign
    - **Outbound number**: Which phone number to make the calls from
    - **Start time**: Launch now or schedule for a future date
    - **Time range**: During what hours calls can be made
    - **Retries**: How many times to call back if the person doesn't answer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the AI agent">
    Choose which of your AI agents will make the calls for this campaign. If you don't have one yet, you can create one from the [Agents section](/en/agents/overview).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load your contacts">
    You have three ways to load contacts into the campaign:

    - **From another campaign**: Reuse contacts from a previous campaign.
    - **Upload a file**: Upload an Excel file with your contact data.
    - **From the CRM**: Select contacts from one of your boards in the ContactShip CRM.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the data template">
    Define which data fields to include for each contact. At minimum, **4 fields** are required (first name, last name, phone number, and country), but you can add many more to **enrich the calls** — for example, product of interest, outstanding debt, last purchase, etc.

    If you chose to upload a file, you can **download the template** in Excel, fill it in Google Sheets or Excel, and then upload it.

    <Tip>
    The more information you load for each contact, the more personalized the call will be. The AI agent uses all this data to adapt the conversation.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the campaign">
    Confirm and launch. The campaign activates within **3 to 5 minutes** at most, and calls are launched **simultaneously** to multiple contacts at once — they're not made one at a time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens after each call

Once calls start running, you can see everything that happens in real time from the **Calls** section on the platform:

- **Full audio** of the call to listen to the conversation
- **Transcription** of everything that was said
- **Summary** automatically generated by the AI
- **User sentiment** — how the person felt during the call
- **Call status** — whether it was successful (the agent achieved its goal) or not
- **Disconnection reason** — who hung up and why

From the **CRM**, you can also see all contact information: add tags, write comments, view the complete call history, create notes, and assign tasks.

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Tips for effective campaigns**
- Start with a small test group to fine-tune your agent before scaling
- Schedule calls during reasonable business hours
- Set up retries for unanswered calls (2-3 retries usually works well)
- Enrich your contact data — the more info the agent has, the better it personalizes
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Keep in mind**
- Make sure you comply with local calling regulations in your country
- Keep your contact lists up to date
- Respect do-not-call preferences
- Test your agent thoroughly before launching at scale
</Warning>
