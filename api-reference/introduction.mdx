## Welcome to the Contactship API Documentation

Welcome to the Contactship API documentation! Here, you'll find everything you need to know to get started with our API, which allows you to create automations or workflows for making phone calls with our AI Agents.

### What is the Contactship API?

The Contactship API is a powerful tool that enables you to programmatically interact with our AI Agents. You can use it to automate tasks, create call workflows, and integrate our services into your own applications. Whether you need to schedule calls, retrieve call data, or manage your agents, our API has you covered.

### Why Use the Contactship API?

Our API is designed to be powerful yet easy to use. Here are some reasons why you might want to use it:

- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks and streamline your call workflows.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate our AI Agents into your own applications.
- **Data Access**: Retrieve and manipulate call data programmatically.
- **Scalability**: Build scalable solutions that can grow with your needs.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Contactship API, follow these simple steps:

1. **Create Your API Key**: 
   - Go to the "Organizations" section in your Contactship dashboard.
   - Generate your API Key, which will be used to authenticate your requests.

2. **Authentication**: All API endpoints are authenticated using your API Key. You will need to include your API Key in the header of each request.
   - Example:
```json  
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
```
3. **Making Requests**: Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the API endpoints. Each endpoint is documented with the required parameters and example responses.

4. **Understanding Responses**: The API will return responses in JSON format. Each response includes relevant data and status codes to indicate the success or failure of the request.

### Resources

Our API documentation is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the API:

- **Authentication**: Learn how to authenticate your requests.
- **Endpoints**: Detailed information about each API endpoint, including parameters and example responses.
- **Error Handling**: Understand the different error codes and how to handle them.
- **Best Practices**: Tips and guidelines for using the API effectively.
