```javascript JavaScript Example
// Using Fetch API to delete a contact
const deleteContact = async (contactId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.contactship.ai/v1/contacts/${contactId}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': 'your-api-key'
      }
    });
    
    if (response.status === 204) {
      console.log('Contact deleted successfully');
      return true;
    } else if (response.status === 404) {
      console.error('Contact not found');
      return false;
    } else {
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => null);
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}, Message: ${errorData?.message || 'Unknown error'}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting contact:', error);
    return false;
  }
};

// Call the function with a contact ID
const contactId = 'c1a2b3c4-d5e6-f7g8-h9i0-j1k2l3m4n5o6';
deleteContact(contactId).then(success => {
  if (success) {
    // Update your UI or take next steps after successful deletion
    console.log('Contact has been removed from the system');
  }
});
```

```python Python Example
import requests

# Replace with your actual API key
api_key = "your-api-key"

# Base URL for the API
base_url = "https://api.contactship.ai"

# Contact ID to delete
contact_id = "c1a2b3c4-d5e6-f7g8-h9i0-j1k2l3m4n5o6"

# Headers
headers = {
    "x-api-key": api_key
}

# Function to delete a contact
def delete_contact(contact_id):
    # Make the DELETE request
    response = requests.delete(
        f"{base_url}/v1/contacts/{contact_id}", 
        headers=headers
    )
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 204:
        print(f"Contact {contact_id} deleted successfully")
        return True
    elif response.status_code == 404:
        print("Error: Contact not found")
        return False
    else:

        except:
            print(response.text)
        return False

# Delete the contact
delete_successful = delete_contact(contact_id)

## Notes and Best Practices

- Always confirm with the user before permanently deleting a contact
- Consider implementing a "soft delete" in your application by flagging contacts as inactive instead of permanently deleting them
- Keep audit logs of deleted contacts for compliance purposes
- Ensure you have proper error handling for failed deletion attempts
- If you're deleting contacts as part of a bulk operation, implement rate limiting to avoid API throttling
